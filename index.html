            <p >Linux is a generic name for a family of open-source Unix-</br>operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an</br>
                operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991,by</br>Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged</br>
                as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and</br>supporting system software and libraries,</br>
                many of which are provided by the GNU Project.
            </p>
            <p >It was originally developed for personal computers</br>based on the Intel x86 architecture, but
                </br>has since been ported to more platforms than any</br>other operating system.Because of the dominance
                </br>of Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux,</br>including Android, has the largest installed base
                </br>of all general-purpose operating systems as of May 2022.</p>

            WHAT ARE LINUX</br>DISTROS?
            <p>
                Linux distributions, or "distros," are different versions of the Linux</br>
                operating system, each tailored for specific needs or preferences.</br>
                Since Linux is open-source, developers can modify it and create their</br>
                own version, adding different software, user interfaces, and tools.</br>
                Some distros, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint, are designed to be user-friendly</br>
                for beginners, while others like Arch Linux are more customizable for</br>
                advanced users. Each distro offers a unique experience, but they </br>
                share the same Linux core, making them compatible with the same</br>
                software and features.
